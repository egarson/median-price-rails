# median-price-rails

Welcome to median-price-rails. This is the server side of a (very) simple system that demonstrates fundamental RESTful principles and was built for a prospective employer to show basic Ruby and web architecture skills. As this was built purely for pedagogical purposes, it omits crucial aspects of systems development, such as any notion of security.

A mobile client (see [median-price-android](http://github.com/egarson/median-price-android) complements and integrates with this system.

This was built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), an MVC-based web framework that has pretty good support for [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) out of the box (see below for more).

## What does it Do?

This application provides a service to calculate the median price paid for a given Item scoped on some set of attributes. For example, the median price paid for a 2005 BMW, or all 2005-2008 Fords, and so on. The idea is to provide the user with some notion of 'fair market value' for a used Vehicle, or some other item.

Again, this was built for pedagogical purposes, so attributes are not assigned dynamically by category, which could be one approach to reify this functionality in a 'real' application. That is to say, the notion of brand and year do not apply to the sale of all Items, which this system assumes.

## Pragmatic REST (hint: not HATEOS)

The flavor of REST as implemented by this application lies somewhere between Level 2 and 3 of the [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html). This is because Rails takes a pragmatic approach to REST which 'out of the box' does not fully achieve [HATEOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) nirvana. To be fully Level 3, a relation would need to be set up with Item (such as Category, as per the above) with links returned in the payload to demonstrate **connectedness**, which is a core tenet of RESTful applications (and indeed, the driver behind HATEOS). Rails provides a modicum of connectedness via the *Location* HTTP header, which is useful to clients particularly in the context of POST (as the server appropriately returns the generated resource's URI).

## Testing Notes

* [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) was used in preference to Test::Unit, mostly because it's what I've been using with Ruby for the last while

## TODO

In no particular order, here are the next items I would have liked to implement:

* version the api: URIs should read something like, /median/v1/...
* implement NOT_MODIFIED/304 via ETags
* return something sensible on NOT_FOUND/404
* implement an example of FORBIDDEN/403 (PUT to /item/<id> with an initialized :paid field)
* and, add an administrative back-door to enable PUT to a sold item using a 'magic' header
* disallow both null year and brand
* add Allow header
* return a modicum of documentation from the root uri
* batching large results
* add performance/load tests using [tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/) which I really like

## High-Level Setup Guide

See [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) for more info on the following:

* Install Rails (>= 3.2.13) and Postgres (>= 9.1.9) and the requisite gems (n.b. there is a Gemfile)
* Create a user *median*, put the password in config/database.yml, give it create priviledges and generate the database
* Run the unit tests with `bundle exec rspec` to smoke test the installation
* Launch the rails server with `rails -s` from the root of the application
* Make curl requests to it; read the tests to get a feel for what you can do with it
